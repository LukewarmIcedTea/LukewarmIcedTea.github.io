# Yeye Jin – Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis project page for my data science class. This site will collect the data sources, ideas, and visualizations I build across the semester.

## Data Sources and Project Ideas

Here are five data sources I am considering for future analysis projects, along with ideas for what I could do with each:

1. **NOAA Climate Data** – [Link](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/)  
   Historical weather and climate measurements. I could examine temperature trends over time in different regions or compare precipitation patterns.

2. **World Bank Open Data** – [Link](https://data.worldbank.org/)  
   Global indicators on economics, health, and development. I could compare GDP, life expectancy, or education levels across countries and look for relationships between variables.

3. **Our World in Data** – [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/)  
   Curated datasets on topics like population, energy, and global health. I could analyze COVID-19 case trends, vaccination rates, or changes in energy use.

4. **CDC Public Health Data** – [Link](https://data.cdc.gov/)  
   U.S. health and disease statistics. I could study how certain conditions vary by state, or how incidence rates change over time.

5. **City of Seattle Open Data** – [Link](https://data.seattle.gov/)  
   City-level data such as 911 calls, traffic, and building permits. I could explore spatial patterns of incidents or how permit activity changes over the year.

## Where's Schueller?

Below is an interactive Plotly visualization from my “Where’s Schueller?” geolocation analysis. It is embedded here as a live figure so that viewers can pan, zoom, and hover over the data points.

## Above & Beyond

For my above-and-beyond element, I added a small navigation bar at the top of the page that links to each section (Home, Data Sources, Where’s Schueller, and Above & Beyond). This makes the page easier to navigate, especially as it grows. I also wrote fuller descriptions of each data source so future me can quickly remember what questions I wanted to explore with each dataset.
